# The disposable-VM campaign

A protected, opt-in campaign that runs the scenarios continuous integration **structurally cannot**, inside a virtual machine you are willing to throw away.

## What CI already covers, and what it cannot

A GitHub-hosted runner is a disposable, elevated, explicitly armed Windows machine, and this project already uses it for everything it can honestly cover: every suite on both shipped hosts, the analyzer, the repository hygiene gates, and a live deployment-lifecycle lane that registers, starts and removes the real scheduled task.

Four things it cannot do, at all:

| | Why a runner cannot | What the campaign does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A real power cut mid-transaction | A runner cannot lose power on cue. A simulated interruption proves the code path, never the state the transaction left the machine in. | `Stop-VM -TurnOff` at an instant **the guest itself asks for**, then start it again and verify recovery |
| A real restart | The restart proof reads a monotonic native counter; only an actual reboot moves it, and a test that fakes the counter proves arithmetic | `reboot-recovery` restarts the guest for real, across an open transaction |
| Service-dispatched maintenance | The live lane's task pointed at a deployment root that did not exist, so the scheduler started an action that failed on its working directory. **The cleanup itself has never run end to end in a guest.** | `service-dispatched-maintenance` installs for real, lets the Task Scheduler dispatch it as SYSTEM, and reads the run's own `.summary.json` |
| A representative Windows 11 client | Real drivers, a real component store, a real profile | The guest is one |

**Nothing here reinterprets CI as having performed any of it.** A scenario that did not run is reported in the report's own `notRun` list, never omitted into looking like a pass.

## The credential boundary, which is also the protection

The host never asks for, accepts, stores or logs a guest credential. It has exactly two channels:

- **host to guest** — `Copy-VMFile`, over the Guest Service Interface. Delivers files. **Cannot start anything.**
- **guest to host** — Key-Value Pair Exchange. The guest writes its own values under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Virtual Machine\Guest`; the host reads them off the running machine's KVP component. No logon, no share, no port.

Because neither channel can run code in the guest, a campaign requires a guest that was armed **once, deliberately, by its owner**. That is what makes this opt-in structural rather than a flag somebody can set by accident.

## Arming a guest (once, inside the VM, elevated)

**This step cannot be done from the host, and that is not a gap in the tooling.** Every credential-free
route from outside the guest is a technique in its own right: reaching into the offline disk to write
a startup entry in the registry is how credentials are extracted offline, and writing a boot-time
script into the guest's local Group Policy is persistence. Both were tried from the host here and both
were refused by the platform, correctly. The one remaining route, PowerShell Direct, requires guest
credentials by design. So arming is a deliberate act performed by the person who owns the machine —
which is exactly the property that makes a campaign opt-in.


1. Copy this `Tests/Campaign` folder into the guest.
2. Run, elevated, in the guest:

```bash
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Register-WacCampaignAgent.ps1
```

It refuses to arm anything that looks like physical hardware, registers one SYSTEM scheduled task that starts the agent at every boot — which is how the agent comes back after a scenario cuts the power — and publishes a probe value to the host.

3. Back on the **host**, confirm the return channel before trusting it:

```bash
. .\Tests\Campaign\WacCampaignChannel.ps1
(Read-WacCampaignReport -VMName 'Test VM')['ArmingProbe']
```

It must print the timestamp the arming step showed. If it prints nothing, the guest has no way to report results and no campaign should be run until that is fixed.

Disarm with `-Unregister`.

## Running a campaign (on the host)

```bash
$env:WAC_VM_CAMPAIGN = '1'
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\Tests\Campaign\Invoke-WacVmCampaign.ps1 -VMName 'Test VM'
```

The driver takes a checkpoint **before** anything is delivered, stages the project from committed `HEAD` (never the working tree — evidence bound to uncommitted edits is bound to no reviewable state), runs the scenarios, restores the checkpoint, and leaves the machine **off**, verified.

| Exit | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | every requested scenario ran and passed |
| 1 | the campaign ran and something failed — read the report |
| 2 | refused: not armed, or a destructive scenario without its own authorization |
| 3 | blocked: it did not run. **Not evidence about the product.** |

### Scenarios

`service-dispatched-maintenance`, `power-loss-during-install`, `power-loss-during-uninstall` and `reboot-recovery` run by default.

`driver-prune` and `reset-base` are **destructive** and gated twice, on the host and again in the guest:

```bash
$env:WAC_VM_CAMPAIGN = '1'
$env:WAC_VM_CAMPAIGN_DESTRUCTIVE = '1'
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\Tests\Campaign\Invoke-WacVmCampaign.ps1 -VMName 'Test VM' -Scenario reset-base -AllowDestructive
```

`reset-base` permanently removes the ability to uninstall updates installed before the run, and `driver-prune` removes superseded driver packages. Both are isolated by the checkpoint the driver takes, and `-AllowDestructive` never implies `WAC_VM_CAMPAIGN_DESTRUCTIVE` or the other way round: one authorizes driving a guest, the other authorizes what may happen inside it.

## How an interruption is timed

Not on a stopwatch. The agent starts the real operation, waits for the record the **product itself** writes when it enters the transaction — `<deployment root>.transaction.json`, `.taskcapture.json` or `.uninstall.json`, which live beside the root so no move or delete carries them off — and only then asks the host to cut the power. A cut on a timer lands wherever the machine happened to be, which makes a pass unrepeatable and a failure undiagnosable.

The resume point is written to disk **before** the cut is requested. After the power goes there is nothing left but that file, and a resume point written afterwards is one that was never written.

## Status

**The campaign has run for real**, on a Hyper-V Windows 11 guest, on 2026-09-19. Two of the four
default scenarios passed, and they are the two this work exists for:

| scenario | verdict | what it showed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `service-dispatched-maintenance` | **passed** | the Task Scheduler dispatched the installed action as SYSTEM and the cleanup ran to completion: `lastResult=0`, outcome `Succeeded`, 203 entries and 13.4 MB actually removed, read from the run's own `.summary.json` |
| `power-loss-during-install` | **passed** | a real power cut at the instant the guest reported reaching the transaction; after restart, recovery left the files, the registration and the records agreeing |
| `power-loss-during-uninstall` | failed | **a defect in this campaign, not in the product** — a short uninstall can finish between the guest asking for the cut and the host taking it, so nothing was interrupted |
| `reboot-recovery` | failed | **a defect in this campaign** — it inherited the previous scenario's half-removed state and was refused before it began |

Both failures are worth reading for what they show about the product: the installer met an
outstanding uninstall intent, refused, named the condition, said which manual step clears it, and
confirmed that nothing was staged, swapped or registered. That sentence came off a real machine.

Known limitations, in this order:

1. **The cut is not instantaneous.** It is armed by the guest and taken by the host on its next poll,
   so an operation that finishes inside that window is not interrupted at all.
2. **Scenarios are not isolated from one another.** They run in sequence on an accumulating guest, so
   one that leaves the machine in a refused state blocks the next.

Until those are closed, `power-loss-during-uninstall` and `reboot-recovery` prove nothing either way.
